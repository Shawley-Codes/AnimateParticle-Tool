    Instuctions: To animate particles, either by parenting or by motion path,
    select an option parent or path and then select either the object or curve
    (based on which option) and click execute.
    
    Motion Path: Selecting the motion path option will require you to input the desired
    frames for which to animate from and too. Please select a curve to be turned into a motion
    path for which to animate the object along.
