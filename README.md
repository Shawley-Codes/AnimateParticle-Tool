    Instuctions: To animate particles, either by parenting or by motion path,
    select an option parent or path and then select either the object or curve
    (based on which option) and click execute.
    
    Motion Path: Selecting the motion path option will require you to input the desired
    frames for which to animate from and too. Please select a curve to be turned into a motion
    path for which to animate the object along. 
    
    Parent: Selecting the object will spawn and position the particle emitter on a section of
    the geometry. It can be moved after creation to the desired location. 
   
To call this tool, you can run the name or add it to a script calling program. Otherwise uncomment the #main() that is under testing at the bottom of the code to run it in the script editor.
